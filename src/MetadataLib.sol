/*
 This is a Solidity library that handles operations related to metadata management.
 Libraries in Solidity are similar to utility classes in other programming languagesâ€”they
 provide reusable functions that can be called by contracts.
    
Key Features:
- Functions to create, update, and retrieve metadata for smart contracts.
- Utilities for handling common tasks related to metadata, such as formatting or validation.
- Helps to keep the ENSMetadata.sol contract clean by abstracting metadata logic into a separate module.
