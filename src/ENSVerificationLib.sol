/*
Purpose: This is another Solidity library, but it specifically focuses on ENS (Ethereum Name Service) verification.
It provides reusable functions that handle the process of verifying that a smart contractâ€™s address matches a registered ENS name.

Key Features:
- Functions to verify the ENS name associated with a contract.
- Logic for checking if the ENS name is correctly linked to the contract's address.
- Abstracts the ENS verification logic from the main contract (ENSMetadata.sol), making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
